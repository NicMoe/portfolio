## Context

Browser capabilities and front-end technologies are getting more advanced and robust every day. Organizations expect front-end developers to deliver more sophisticated UX and UI patterns to their end-users every day. Implementing innovative user interfaces can be very rewarding. However, the quest for victory can be full of dead ends and frustration.

## Content

In this talk, I demonstrate how I've solved tough front-end challenges by breaking down insurmountable requirements into solvable chunks and using the world wide web for inspiration to build the IBM Data Explorer [query builder](/projects/query-builder).

## Audiences

This talk is for any professional who works on web experiences. I have given this talk at IBM's global meetup of front-end developers with over 100 attendees.
