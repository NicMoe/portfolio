## Context

Austin EcoNetwork is an environmental news website for Austin. The organization wanted to give readers the background information and context they need to understand the dayâ€™s news stories conversationally.

## My role

As the sole volunteer on the project, I designed and developed a notecards application with questions and answers like studying cards to learn the background story of a narrowly focused topic.

## Solution

I created the application to be back-end agnostic. For this instance, the Austin EcoNetwork staff use their already existing Wordpress site admin dashboard to create and update notecards.
