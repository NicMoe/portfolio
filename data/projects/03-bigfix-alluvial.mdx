## Context

Software security vulnerabilities are discovered and relentlessly exploited daily. Security professionals have their hands full with finding, investigating, and remediating these vulnerabilities. They need a way to find the most prevalent threats and apply patches that most impact their organization.

## My role

I worked as a data visualization developer collaborating closely with the designers to understand the interactions and the engineering team to develop a component aligned with their tech stack.

## Solution

I developed a vanilla JavaScript alluvial data visualization component using D3 and the Sankey module. The visualization enabled users to see the connections across the nodes with hover interactions and dig deeper into the data by breaking nodes into subnodes.

## Outcome

The IBM BigFix for QRadar engineering team added the visualization component into their application, making it the most prominent user interface feature.
