## Context

Software security vulnerabilities are discovered and relentlessly exploited daily. Security professionals have their hands full with finding, investigating, and remediating these vulnerabilities. They need a way to find the most prevalent threats based on high severity vulnerabilities and the assets at risk to apply patches that most impact their organization.

## My role

I worked as a data visualization developer collaborating closely with the designers to understand the interactions and the engineering team to develop a component aligned with their tech stack. I continue to work with the UX designers further to document this visualization as a standard [design pattern](https://carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/advanced-charts#alluvialsankey-diagrams).

## Solution

I developed a JavaScript alluvial data visualization component using d3.js and the Sankey module. The visualization enables users to see at a high-level which operating systems in their infrastructure contain known security vulnerabilities and trace that information to the patch that protects the asset from an attack.

## Outcome

The IBM BigFix for QRadar engineering team added the visualization component into their application, making it the most prominent user interface feature.
