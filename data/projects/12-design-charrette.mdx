## Context

We switched from an off-the-shelf BI tool (Mode Analytics) to building our own custom dashboards and data visualizations (d3.js/Vega, Vue). We needed flexible, performant, stable vis components.

## My role

I was the lead front-end engineer for this project and the application. On my team were several designers and the lead back-end engineer to help implement the editor.

## Process

We switched from an off-the-shelf BI tool (Mode Analytics) to building our own custom dashboards and data visualizations (d3.js/Vega, Vue). We needed flexible, performant, stable vis components.

My approach: technologies used, people processes used, methodologies, tools, and specific techniques used

As we were rebuilding everything for the switchover, we started with the most common chart types - bar, line, and scatterplot charts. To make sure we considered all important user factors before coding anything, we needed to think about each property of the charts - size, scale, color, etc. I wanted to iteratively include user feedback so we didn’t miss anything or make major architectural mistakes, but we also didn’t want to use up valuable user research resources on client users.

## Solution

Recognizing that company staff were similar in education and data literacy to our users, I decided to apply a concept I learned in architecture school - the design charrette.

Design charrettes are an interactive process involving a physical model or rendering, often of a building or a streetscape, that participants can see, touch, talk about, and leave post-its of their reactions. In this case, instead of getting feedback on a building model, I wanted to get feedback on charts. I used examples of charts we would typically show (in the existing BI), plus examples I found elsewhere on the web, and even some historical charts to really get discussions going. I printed everything out, stuck each chart example to a wall within a large conference room, and asked folks to provide feedback on post-its of what they liked, what they didn’t, what was clear, and what was confusing.

I invited the entire company to attend, and in total had probably 30 or so participants from the tech and product teams, but also from research, client-facing teams, marketing, finance, and HR.

## Outcome

The result was that we had 30 educated perspectives on chart attributes that allowed me to confidently write up the specs for our initial charts. And because my specialty data viz team was small and new, it was a great way to engage the whole company with our work and get them excited about the analytics tools we were building. As well, since I’d only been at the company a few months, it helped me identify internal partners who could provide future feedback which was critical to our iterative, user-centered analytics development.

## Insights

I learned certain distinctions between more analytical professionals (think finance) vs. others that informed the feedback provided in terms of their data and chart literacy. As I got more engaged with our client users, I learned that this distinction existed within their professions as well, and that feedback needed to come from both perspectives to make sure the message depicted was clear.

As well, some of the comments were based on “best practice” for (printed) chart design often taught in k-12 schools that differs from “best practice” modern browser-based interactive visualization. For example, some commenters expected axis lines and a legend on every chart - which is great practice for printed materials but could create unnecessary distractions or less clarity on some chart types. For line charts for example, one good option is to eschew a legend in favor of directly labeling lines. And in certain contexts, other types of labeling or interactions can be more clear than standard axis lines with tick marks.

Staff associated the company’s brand color (affectionately called “blurple”) as being positive, so that suggested that we use it to represent recommendations.

## What I would do differently next time

This was done in an office setting where I could easily advertise my event with a simple sign hanging outside the bathrooms, and people who wander over when they needed an afternoon break. For hybrid or remote settings, this process would require collaborative design tools to get feedback, although the organic “art gallery style” conversations would be hard to replicate.
