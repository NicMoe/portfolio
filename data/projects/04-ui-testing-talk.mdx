## Abstract

As web applications continue to evolve into complex systems, developers today are building more and more user-interfaces with component-based frameworks like React and Vue. As a result, UI unit testing today is easier than it has ever been before, but where do you start? If you feel like unit testing is a guessing game, this talk is for you!

In this talk, I guide you with a practical approach to testing UI components with Jest and Storybook to improve your front-end's quality and solve user needs.

## Audiences

I have given this talk at [LibertyJS](https://libertyjs.com/schedule/2019-10-24?sessionId=uiComponentTesting) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, ChicagoJS in Chicago, Illinois, JavaScript & Friends in Columbus, Ohio, and globally within IBM.
