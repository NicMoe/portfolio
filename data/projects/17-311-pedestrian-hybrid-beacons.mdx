## Context

Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons (PHB's) are traffic control devices installed at crosswalks to improve pedestrian safety. According to the [Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/pedestrian-bicyclist/safety-countermeasures/pedestrian-hybrid-beacon-guide-recommendations), PHB's can reduce pedestrian-related crashes by 69% and total crashes by 29%. They are particularly useful where traditional crosswalk signs and markings are ineffective in prompting sufficient motorist yielding and where a full traffic signal isn't justifiable due to deployment issues or costs. PHB's are commonly placed at mid-block crossings or uncontrolled mainline crossing points - locations that are notorious for most pedestrian fatalities in the US.

In Austin, the process for installing a PHB often begins with a public request via the city's 3-1-1 service. These requests are then evaluated based on various criteria such as the difficulty of crossing the street, pedestrian environment (including crash history and nearby pedestrian "generators" like schools or parks), and community considerations like alignment with local planning. Locations that meet these criteria are ranked, and the top ones undergo an engineering study. If a PHB is recommended, it's added to a construction list to be installed as funding becomes available.

## My role

## Process

As board chair for Vision Zero ATX, I wanted to teach community members how to use civic reporting tools for advocacy. Since PHB installations require a 3-1-1 request, I decided to use data that I'd collected for a [mapping project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vision.zero.atx/viz/2015VisionZeroATXdashboard_0/Dashboard) covered by the [local NPR affiliate](https://www.kut.org/transportation/2015-08-04/map-austins-traffic-fatalities-so-far-in-2015) and identify locations without safe crossing infrastructure.

Where pedestrian / driver interactions had turned deadly, I wanted to make sure these sites were evaluated for improved crossing infrastructure.

## Solution

## Outcome

Out of the 23 locations we requested an evaluation for PHB placement, 3 were ultimately determined to meet the criteria and PHB's were constructed.

3 new PHB’s in high-value locations:

## Insights

## What I would do differently next time

This project was primarily meant to teach volunteers how to use the 311 system to advocate their needs to city government. While I was able to leverage a bit of data to make sure this exercise would be both educational and impactful, I think we could’ve had a bit greater impact by advocating the city to automate their process so (1) the process to initiate an assessment wasn’t dependent on specific requests from the public and so (2) the assessment process itself could help transportation engineers know the most impactful sites ahead of time.
