## Context

IBM Security's portfolio of products is expansive. It encompasses numerous web applications such as the IBM Cloud Pak for Security platform, Data Explorer, Guardium Insights, and Verify. We needed to have a way to ensure consistent user-experiences and design language to establish a brand.

## My role

I collaborated with numerous talented front-end engineers to investigate and test multiple approaches like the Material Components for Web adaptors architecture, ultimately creating the library. Later, as an extensive library user, I have implemented several vital components, like the [Filter Panel](https://ibm-security.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/patterns-filterpanel--default), and mentored other engineers new to open-source projects in contributing theirs.

## Outcome

Carbon for IBM Security is now part of the design system that strings together the IBM Cloud Pak for Security platform and application experiences. The system has also grown to include a Sketch library for designers.
