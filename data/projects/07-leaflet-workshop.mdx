## Context

Leaflet.js is an open-source Javascript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Similar to Google Maps, it provides a presentational layer to geographical data.

## Content

In this workshop, I guide attendees through the development of their first leaflet.js web map. I start with the rationale for mapping with open-source tools like leaflet.js instead of proprietary GIS software. I discuss the data to visualize that I gathered from the United States Census Bureau. Then we build a map to show transportation mode usage across the main metropolitan areas in the country.

## Audiences

This talk is for anyone interested in the topic. I have led this workshop at the [Chicago Data Viz Community](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Data-Viz-Community/events/258194723) meetup.
