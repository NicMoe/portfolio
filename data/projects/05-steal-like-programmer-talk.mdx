## Abstract

Browser capabilities and front-end technologies are getting more advanced and robust every day. Front-end developers are expected to deliver more sophisticated UX and UI patterns to our end-users every day as well. Implementing innovative user interfaces can be very rewarding. However, the quest to victory can be full of dead ends and frustration.

Come on a journey as I demonstrate how I've solved tough front-end challenges by breaking down insurmountable requirements into solvable chunks and using the world wide web for inspiration to create your own UI masterpiece.

## Audiences

I have given this talk at IBM's global meetup of front-end developers.
