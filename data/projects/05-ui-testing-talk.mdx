## Context

As web applications continue to evolve into complex systems, developers today build more and more user-interfaces with component-based frameworks like React and Vue. As a result, UI unit testing today is easier than it has ever been before, but where does one start testing?

## Content

In the talk, I cover the rationale for wanting to test UI components. I then dive into manually testing with Storybook and automatic testing with Jest and DOM Testing Library. I keep the concepts general to make them relevant to developers working with React, Vue, and Angular.

## Audiences

This talk is for experienced front-end developers. I have given this talk at [LibertyJS](https://libertyjs.com/schedule/2019-10-24?sessionId=uiComponentTesting) (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), ChicagoJS (Chicago, Illinois), JavaScript & Friends (Columbus, Ohio), and globally within IBM.
