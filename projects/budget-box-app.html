			<h3>Problem</h3>
			<p>I was fortunate to work on a user-centered project with a great team on an ongoing project for the City of Austin at the Code Across event hosted by Open Austin in 2015. The Budget in a Box board game is a project developed by the city in 2013 to collect feedback from residents on their priorities in regards to the city budget for the following fiscal year. Having seen great success with the game, the Office of Public Information wanted to bring the experience to the digital world to increase public engagement.</p>
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>I worked both in visual and user experience design, and as a front-end developer. I created wireframes, designs, and the HTML and CSS to bring the designs to life. Through this process, learned a great deal about end-user testing and accessibility concerns to consider moving forward, such as screen readers and accessible color choices.</p>
			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p>I helped adapt the board game to the a digital game, creating a high-fidelity proof of concept, and deployed to the public over a period of about 4 months. The digital Budget in a Box resulted in a 214% increase in online public engagement, and we received an award of recognition from Mayor Adler on October 1, 2015.</p>
