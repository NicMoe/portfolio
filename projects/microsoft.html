		<h3>Problem</h3>
		Moving to the cloud can be a daunting task for IT professionals. There are many things to consider like current infrastructure, user needs, and management support before making the move. Microsoft was looking to create a fun tool to help IT professionals understand how ready they and their peers are for the cloud, as well as provide resources to help them get up to speed if they’re not ready. 
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		Our team proposed an interactive quiz that would assess on a high level where the user stands in terms of cloud-readiness. Through a set of simple multiple-choice questions, the quiz would assess the user’s situation and give them a cloud ranking along with relevant resources based on their result. As an added bonus, the user can see how their answers compares to their peers.
		<h3>Execution</h3>
		To develop the quiz, it was important that I developed it in a modular component-focused way to allow for easy additions of new features and iterative improvements. This approach turned out to be very beneficial when we were asked to translate the quiz into about 20 different languages.
		<h3>Tools</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Backbone.js</strong> for the framework to have a simple object-oriented architecture</li>
			<li><strong>D3.js</strong> for generating charts</li>
			<li><strong>Webpack</strong> to modularize application Javascript</li>
			<li><strong>Sass</strong> for a powerful CSS structure that was easy to manage</li>
			<li>And of course, <strong>good ol’ HTML</strong></li>
		</ul>
