			<p>I enjoy coding and design. I currently work at Spiceworks where I surround myself with very talented people to develop digital advertising experiences for companies like Microsoft, Lenovo, and HP. I use mostly front-end web technology to create these experiences as well as some design tools and a little bit of back-end elbow grease to polish everything off.</p>
			<p>I enjoy helping my local community using the skills that I have. This includes the Budget in a Box application for the City of Austin and context notes for Austin EcoNetwork. I also think it’s important to give back to the tech community. I’ve presented on exciting tools like design patterns and Sass color functions at Spiceworks and to groups like Sass ATX and Open Austin.</p>
			<p>In my time off, when I’m not coding away on a personal or volunteer project, you’ll often find me hiking or exploring delicious food around Austin, TX.</p>
